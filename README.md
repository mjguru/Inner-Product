# Inner-Product

This repo hosts code for the paper "Optimal Depth-Three Circuits for Inner Product" that you can access at https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04446. The code here solves various optimization problems arising in the paper.

This code uses [ibex library](https://ibex-team.github.io/ibex-lib/) to solve the optimization problems. After installing the library, execute ``ibexopt --trace region3.bch`` on command line to run the optimization code for region 3 and execute ``ibexopt --trace region4.bch`` to run the optimization for region 4.
